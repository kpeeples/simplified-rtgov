Version 1  
  
Welcome to the Simplified demo series.  Please open the readme.html for the detailed steps to run the demo as well as additional information.  I refer to this as a workshop in a box, meaning everything is included to get you started such as the source, instructions, videos, presentations, etc. This demo will walk you through a quick demo of Run Time Governance in Fuse Service Works. It is split into 3 main sections. First is the quick demo which walks you through the quick steps to run a quick, easy demo (The What). The second section gives an overview of the technology and how the demo was created (The Why and How). The third section gives you additional collateral. So letâ€™s get started and as they say so easy a non techie can do it...
